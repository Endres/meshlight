Develop a Python Painlessmesh Library:
  - User needs to connect to mesh wifi himself (more easy)

init:
  - lists all wireless network interfaces
  - tries to connect to the router of each wireless interface to port 5555 tcp
    - this is the mesh network IP/port combination when communicating with the
      node, which we participate as client
  - then we need to exchange single TCP packets containing JSON formatted data,
    which is the internal painlessmesh protocol
  - as packets might be lost, we need to care for resending, while TCP seems to
    not be implemented very good (and still we have multiple parties
    communicating on the very same wireless channel leading to errors)

json format:
{
  "root": boolean,
  "from": int,
  "dest": int,
  "type": int,
  "subs": [{"nodeId": int, "root": boolean}],
  "msg": string,
  # timesync
  "msg": {
    "type": int,
    "t0": int,
    "t1": int,
    "t2": int,
  },
  "routing": int
}

"""class tcp(object):
    def encodeNodeId(hwaddr):
        return int.from_bytes(hwaddr[2:], byteorder="big")"""
