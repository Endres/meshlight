Mesh-Payload-Frame:
  - 8-bit R, G, B values per connected node (15 nodes: 15*3=45 Bytes)

Node:
  - Has configured ID -> persistent EEPROM style memory in ESP8266??? (ID 0: server / sender, ID 1..N: nodes)
    - we simply use the order of (last four bytes of) MAC addresses (nodeId) in the mesh network
  - If sender of last color is not more connected or no color was sent, turn black after 2 seconds. Any received color will reset this.
  - If frame received, use color starting at byte (ID - 1)*3, reset 2 seconds counter and note sender MAC or identifier

Server:
  - Everytime (max speed has to be determined) it wants to change the color of one node, it sends N*3 bytes as Mesh-Payload-Frame.
