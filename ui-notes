Settings Concept:
  - State machine for setting changing
    - Live changes vs. "saved" changes
    - Live changes can be reverted by clicking on "Revert" or leaving the site (unsaved changes warning!)
    - Saving as well saves a configuration file which is preserved even at server restart
  - Allow storing current animation options as new sequence step "Add to Sequence"
  - Setting request different from frame request
    - Whenever settings are set, store last modification timestamp
    - after defined setting timout (10 minutes), display modal dialog, whether live settings should be saved, continued to be edited or reverted (discarded)
